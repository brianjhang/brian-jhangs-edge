        <p><strong>AI √ó Startups √ó Crypto ‚Äî An AI Solopreneur's Entrepreneurial Experiment</strong></p>
        <p>Front-line reports from building a one-person AI super-entity company</p>
      </div>

      <p>In 2016, I witnessed AlphaGo defeat the world Go champion, realizing that the boundaries of human capability were being rewritten by AI. In 2025, I personally wrote my first line of code with Claude, only to discover that this world-changing power could be wielded by individuals.</p>

      <p><strong>At that moment, a crazy idea ignited in my mind</strong>: What if the three revolutionary forces of AI √ó Startups √ó Crypto perfectly converged? Could I build a "one-person AI super-entity company"?</p>

      <p>What's recorded here isn't a successful person's memoir, but my real-time battle reports on becoming an <strong>AI Solopreneur Unicorn</strong> ‚Äî every exploration, every discovery, every failure is a genuine witness to this unprecedented experiment.</p>

      <h2>üß≠ Why These Three Fields?</h2>
      <p>After deep contemplation, I discovered that 2025's greatest entrepreneurial opportunities lie at the intersection of three forces:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Technology Revolution</strong>: Generative AI is redefining productivity boundaries across all industries</li>
        <li><strong>Startup Innovation Models</strong>: Lean startup + AI-native thinking = unprecedented speed advantages</li>
        <li><strong>Crypto Economic Foundation</strong>: Decentralized technology provides new paradigms for global collaboration and value exchange</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When these three forces combine, they create opportunities for <strong>high-impact yet structurally simple</strong> super-entity companies.</p>

      <h2>üìö My Battle Report Series</h2>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>üéØ My Mission: Becoming an AI Solopreneur Unicorn</h2>
      <p>I'm Brian Jhang, a builder standing at the forefront of the AI revolution. I deeply believe this era's greatest opportunity isn't joining others' battles, but creating entirely new tracks of our own.</p>

      <p>Everything I share here is both my learning notes and my <strong>front-line reports</strong> from conquering unknown territories. Right now, I'm fully focused on conquering two seemingly impossible peaks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Product Development Front</strong>: <strong>Currently seeking and building</strong> truly scalable AI-native applications, daily validating the unknown path to becoming an "AI super-entity." I'm not teaching you how to do it; I'm documenting how I'm breaking through.</li>
        <li><strong>Crypto Strategy Investment Front</strong>: <strong>Currently researching and building</strong> quantitative trading systems that can survive multiple bull and bear cycles, preparing for the coming decentralized economic tide. Every model, every backtest is a footprint of my exploration.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>This isn't success studies or expert courses, but the authentic journal of a crazy explorer.</strong> I'll honestly record every attempt, every hypothesis, every failure, and the occasional breakthrough moments. Because on this path that no one has walked before, the real process is more valuable than glamorous results.</p>
